<h1><em>S=V<sub>i</sub>t+1/2at<sup>2</sup>:The Equation of Linear Equation</em></h1>
<p>The formula <em>S=V<sub>i</sub>t+1/2at<sup>2</sup>:The Equation of Linear Equation</em> describes the motion of an object under constant acceleration.<br>Here, 
<ul> 
<li>S represents the displacement</li>
<li>V<sub>i</sub> is the initial velocity</li>
<li>t is the time</li>
<li>a is the acceleration </li>
<li>1/2at<sup>2</sup> is the additional displacement due to acceleration.</li>
</ul>
</p> 
<p><q>An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an <strong><u>external force</u></strong>.</q></p> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong>This equation was written in 1905.</p>
